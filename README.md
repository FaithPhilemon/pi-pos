# Radmin: Laravel Dashboard Template Starter
Radmin Laravel Starter revolutionizes website management with advanced user and role management, a flexible REST API, server-side datatables, data editing, and export options. The Themekit Bootstrap 4 interface makes managing websites a breeze.

## Basic Installation
1. Create a database in phpmyadmin. Open `.env` file and change following credentials
```
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```
2. You have two options to add the database schema: 
    - either import the `database.sql` file found in the `database` directory 
    - or execute the migration command `php artisan migrate:refresh --seed`

3. Run `php artisan serve` to access the website at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or http://localhost:8000
